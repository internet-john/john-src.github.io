      <h1>Browser Architecture - In a Nutshell</h1>
      <p>
        The morning ritual -- fresh coffee brewed, sunk into your plush bean
        bag, you load up darude.com to enjoy some sweet Sandstorm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Curious how the browser works? Too bad, you've already started reading.
        I'll make it quick.
      </p>
      <p>
        Browsers are an application that lives on an OS. Applications are
        composed of <em>n</em> processes. Processes are individual, siloed
        slices of functionality. They work together through a communication
        protocol called IPC (Inter-Process Communication). Processes are
        composed of <em>n</em> threads. Threads work on tasks that contribute to
        the overall goal of the process. Like...a baby process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyways, for example:
      </p>
      <p>
        The renderer process makes use of compositor threads to rasterize
        individual chunks, aka layer tiles, of the UI. The number of processes
        and threads is continuously in flux. Some considerations are the user
        device constraints, network, and the current number of applications
        already running on OS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let‚Äôs go through a typical user flow:
      </p>
      <h3>User search and navigation</h3>
      <p>
        You enter ‚Äòdarude.com‚Äô to enjoy your daily 8-hour loop of Sandstorm. The
        browser process will recognize the user has made an input and will
        determine what exactly it is. Once it has determined this, it will reach
        out to its network thread that the user wishes to access a website. The
        network process will then perform its due diligence (DNS lookup, verify
        certs, establish TLS, etc). If all looks good, it will check back in
        with the browser process, confirm wish to navigate and browser process
        will then find a renderer process to render the destination site.
      </p>
      <h3>Rendering the page</h3>
      <p>
        Once a renderer process is found, it will reach out to the browser
        process‚Äô network thread for additional info it needs. It will begin
        construction of the DOM tree from the HTML string it receives, with a
        preload scanner operating concurrently to reach out to the browser
        process‚Äô network thread for any additional assets and resources it needs
        fetched.
      </p>
      <p>
        The renderer process will construct a series of trees to better
        understand the HTML. It will first calculate a style tree, via
        user-defined stylesheets and/or browser defaults, then a layout tree,
        which is a hierarchical construct of what the user will see on the page.
        It will then record a paint order to know what elements to draw and
        style first. For example, background, then black rectangle, then orange
        circle, etc.
      </p>
      Now that the renderer process knows the structure, style, and paint order
      of the page, it will invoke its compositor thread to finish the job. The
      compositor thread first separates the page into layers, break into tiles,
      and passes each tile to a raster thread, which essentially takes all the
      calculated information above(trees and paint records), and turns them into
      visual pieces of UI.
      <p>
        These tiles are then rounded up back into layers, and sent to the
        browser process, which then sends them to the GPU to display on the
        screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ta-da! And that‚Äôs a very high level overview of magic behind browsers.
