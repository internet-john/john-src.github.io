        <p>
        A lot of students have asked me what their portfolio should look like to
        come to graduation. Should they have one already? What makes a good
        portfolio project? How do they make themselves a strong candidate for a
        specific company?
        </p>
        <h3>Some thoughts</h3>
        <p>
        Your coursework now should be added to your portfolio on GitHub. All of
        it. We all had to start somewhere, so do not be shy to upload even the
        most basic things. What matters is your growth trajectory. As an employer,
        I want to see that growth -- from learning basic data and decision
        structures up to your capstone project.

        One of the professional software engineer's greatest strength lies in
        their ability to learn quickly, and translate that knowledge into a
        working solution. As a junior engineer, you're literally being paid to
        learn.

        Project Ideas What do YOU enjoy? What could you talk about for hours and
        hours endlessly and drive your friends and family crazy? What problems do
        YOU want to solve? What products do YOU enjoy?
        </p>
        <p>
        Perhaps you love Netflix! Netflix has very specific engineering challenges
        they grapple with that are different from other companies. Go deep on
        streaming technologies, distributed systems, relational databases.
        </p>

        Use <strong>https://stackshare.io/</strong> to find a company's tech
        stack.

        It's very important to identify your passions and what you want to be
        building and solving for as early as possible. The sheer amount of
        knowledge and opportunities are incredible, but also overwhelming! Make it
        easier and more enjoyable by focusing on what gets you excited, and you
        will do exceptional work.

        With this being said, there is absolutely a baseline of fundamentals that
        all software engineers should be familiar with and able to implement. <p>I
        recommend

            href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Freecodecamp.com projects</a

        Do all of them! Do all of them again, but in a different language! Can you
        figure out how to deploy a node service to AWS, expose a public API, and
        consume that in your web app? There are countless ways to solve the
        problem. Keep things spicy and challenge yourself to do it differently
        each time! 
        </p>
        <strong><p>Deliberate, consistent, practice.</p></strong>
        <p> 
        Reading about algorithms and documentation can be dry at times. However, running into the problem
        yourself on a project, finding a solution, and discovering the raison
        d'être is the optimal learning experience. In my opinion :) I've been
        coding professionally for 4 years and still do these freecodecamp projects
        to keep my skills sharp.
        </p>
        <p>
        As for documentation, I recommend
        <strong
            ><a href="https://developers.google.com/web" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Chrome web dev documentation</a
            ></strong
        >
        and
        <strong>
            <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Mozilla web dev documentation</a
            >
        </strong>
        </p>
        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <p>
        Expose your ignorance. Showcase and be proud of your growth. Build a
        strong foundation. Build a portfolio that is geared towards companies you
        want to work for / problems you want to be solving. Consistent,
        deliberate, practice.
