        <h1>CSS Anchors</h1>
        <p>
            A simple way to make your CSS far easier to reason about and debug is
            through the use of anchor styles. To do so, simply apply defaults to the
            html and body tags. Today, we will focus on a <code>font-size</code> anchor
        </p>
        <h3>Anchors away!</h3>
        
        <pre class="code--sample">
        <code>
        html { 
            font-size: 100%; 
        }
        </code>
        </pre>

        <p>Nearly every browser will have a default font size of 16px.</p>

        <!-- <code>
            <h4>body { height: 100vh; width: 100vw; }</h4>
        </code>

        <p>
            Body height and width are at your discretion. Point being, you want to
            have <i>something</i> there.
        </p> -->
        <div>
        <h3>What follows</h3>
        Now that we have a default font-size and known body dimensions, we can
        more easily make use of dynamic sizing for our application content. 
        
        <h3>REM - "root em"</h3>
        <p>
        REM refers to the root element’s font size. Regardless of the nesting of the
        element you wish to style, where it’s located, etc, anything styled with
        the REM unit will be in direct calculation of the root element(html). </p>
        <p>
        Above, we set the font-size to 100% (16px). Therefore, we can safely
        reason about font sizing when using REM. 
        <pre class="code--sample">
        <code> 
        btn--cta {
            font-size: 1.5rem;
        }
            
        __

        1.5rem = (16*1.5) = 24px.
        </code>
        </pre>
        </p>
        <!-- <h3>%, VH, VW</h3>
        <p>% Width and Height will be according to the parent element.</p> For example,
        within our body, we may have a header, list, a few buttons, and a footer.
        Because we have explicitly set the height and width of our body, we can
        easily use % to size our elements. 
        <p>ex)</p>
        <code><h4>header { height: 20%; width: inherit; }</h4></code>
        <p>This states that the header height is equal to 20% of the body height,
        (20 vertical height units). Additionally, if we wish to use the same width
        of the parent element we will use the inherit directive. </p>
        <p>As stated above,
        the height and width of the child element are calculated from the height
        and width of the parent node. Therefore, things could get a bit messy if
        you get quite deeply nested. In that case, we can make use of VH & VW</p> -->

        <h5>TL;DR</h5> 
        <p>Use CSS anchors to have explicit values to refer to better
        understand size calculations. </p><p>Always, always use dynamic sizing units (%,
        VH, VW, em, rem). </p><p>Generally, % and VH/VW are used in conjunction. As for
        EM and REM, once you use one of them, try and stick to it and not mix. REM
        is my choice, as for the reasons stated above.</p>
