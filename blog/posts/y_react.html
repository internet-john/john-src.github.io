      <h1>Why React?</h1>
      <p>
        An odd question to ask in 2020, as the library has matured and become the
        choice of individuals, startups, and enterprise alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rly tho.</strong> Why react? What makes it so special, and how did
        we get here? </p>
      <p>
        The intent of this write up is to give the reader
        insight into React design principles and implementation, 
        and what makes it so special.
      </p>

      <h3>A shifted paradigm</h3>
      <p>
        A large part of traditional web development followed the MVC paradigm.
        Manage models, views, controllers. Manage the instances of these
        controllers, their state, their properties. Update the DOM accordingly.
        Rinse and repeat. As applications scaled and grew in features and
        complexity, it became clear that MVC design patterns and the push approach
        burdered developers with additional cognitive overload.
      </p>
      <p>
        If only there was a library to build interfaces that addressed key pain
        points of web development...
      </p>
      <p>Boy, do I have news for 2013 you!</p>
      <h3>The Tao of React</h3>
      <p>
        As discussed above, their was a number of issues with traditional web
        development. Let’s discuss these one by one and see how React’s design
        addresses this.
      </p>
      <ul class="post__content-list">
        <li><strong>DOM manipulation</strong></li>

        In React, your UI components, whether they be custom (<LilButton />) or
        built-in such as div, it’s all good. Your renders will plain JS objects,
        which properties that describe their type, properties, and children. These
        objects are not instances. In React, they are all elements.

        <p>
          <q>
            <em
            >An element is a plain object describing a component instance or DOM
            node and its desired properties.</em></q></p>

        <li><strong>Instance management</strong></li>

        <p>
          As stated above, your UI components are all elements in React land. When
          a component updates, the state changes but the instance remains the
          same. <em>Nice.</em>
        </p>

        <li><strong>UI updates</strong></li>
        <p>
          This is handled by React reconciliation. The algo relies on two key
          heuristics: 1) Elements of different types produce different trees 2)
          List items contain a key property that unique, stable, and predictable
          as the component renders, re-renders, and re-renders again.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a component is updated, it generates a new tree of JS objects. This
          tree is diffed against the previous one. If the root elements are the
          same type, it moves on to the attributes and styles, updating as
          necessary. It will then repeat this for each child node until the tree
          has been updated where needed. If the root elements are of different
          type, it will tear down the tree and rebuild anew. This new, updated
          tree is then passed to the renderer depending on environment. (ReactDOM
          for web, React-Native for mobile) As we can see, React has taken a lot
          of the work devs would previously managed.
          <p>
          <q>
            <em
              >It is a key goal for React that the amount of the user code that
              executes before yielding back into React is minimal.
            </em></q
          ></p>
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h3>TL;DR</h3>
      <p>
        In summary, React is simply a library fine-tuned for building UI’s. Used
        properly, it removes a lot of headaches web developers would face in every
        day development.
