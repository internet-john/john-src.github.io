        As I return to the tech world, I wanted to brush up on some skills while
        learning a few shiny new things on the way.

      <p>
        My initial goals -- design a web app of sufficient complexity (Twitter
        clone), use React Router, webpack, and typescript. While I accomplished
        this, my main takeaway was tackling performance and gaining a deeper
        understanding of the elements at play. Some things we're complex, but a
        lot of this is low-hanging fruit that I hope you can apply in your
        projects and avoid some head-scratchers.
      </p>
      <p>Done!</p>
      <p>
        Or was I? I ran my project against Lighthouse and the assessment was not
        pretty...
      </p>

      <div>
        <h3>Know thy config</h3>
        <p>
          I attempted to run <code>npm run build</code>to see if I could at
          least see what my build would look like compressed. However, the
          command failed! I realized my webpack config was not configured
          properly! I went on a webpack docs deepdive and pored through each
          property of the webpack config. I noticed something in my config that
          was off Within my output, I used the path <code>dist</code> to output
          my bundle. Within my dev server config, I used the path
          <code>build</code> to ref the bundle generated. Obviously, this
          wouldn't work!
        </p>
        <p>
          The fix here was simple: make sure I'm referencing the same directory
          in both places (I chose <code>dist</code>)
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Bundle Busting</h3>
        <h5>Analysis</h5>
        <p>
          I came across a nice tool called <code>webpack-bundle-analyzer</code>.
          It generates a UI to view your bundle size and opportunities for
          improvement. One glaring issue in my bundle was a few gargantuan third
          party libraries, namely <code>react-icons</code>.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../../assets/images/reacticons_before_fix.png"
          alt="Bundle size prior to fixing react-icons"
          srcset=""
        />
        <p>
          Obviously, WAY too big. I took all imports, centralized them in a
          single project file, then converged on a few choice icon libraries. I
          noticed I eliminated lots of duplicate imports and could avoid a lot
          of libraries not supporting module-based imports.
        </p>
        <p>The result? Bundle size cut in <strong>half!</strong></p>
        <p></p>
      </div>
      <h5>Code splitting</h5>
      <p>
        Any app with a smidge of complexity will be using dependencies. What
        becomes obvious is that your code will, most likely, be changing more
        often than dependencies. (You may be releasing once a week, while your
        <code>@types/...</code> packages at far less frequency(if ever)).
        Therefore, it makes sense to separate your code from your external
        dependencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Webpack makes this very easy with the
        <code>optimization</code> property. Take a look:
      </p>
      <code> ... optimization: { splitChunks: { chunks: "all" } }, ... </code>
      <p>
        This gives us the ability to break down our single bundle into several.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, pairing this with content hashes allows the browser to only
        re-download when a file content changes! The content hash only changes
        when they content of the data itself does. Referring back to our source
        vs dependencies...this allows the client to avoid a ton of superfluous
        network requests.
      </p>
      <code> ... filename: "[name].[contenthash].js", ... </code>
      <p>
        The result? A cool<strong> 95% reduction</strong> in bundle size on
        subsequent page loads.
      </p>

        srcset=""
        style="width: 80vw"
      />
      <h3>TL;DR</h3>
      <p>
        Syntax errors can be costly! (In my case, using both build and dist in
        config).
      </p>
      <p>
        Webpack is extremely powerful and provides a ton of functionality.
        However, it does not come for free.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the browser can do a lot to provide an excellent UX, so
        let's make sure we're leveraging what's available. In this case, adding
        a content hash to our bundle chunks.
