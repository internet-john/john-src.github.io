      <h1>Feature Development for Frontend Devs -- Some considerations</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the biz objective?</li>

        <li>
          How does this feature satisfy biz objective? Tech objective always
          services biz objective. (Consult with product managers, Biz Dev folks)
        </li>

        <li>
          Who are the users? What user pain are we addressing? (Here is the time
          to sync up with design, product managers, customer care reps,
          customers themselves)
        </li>

        <li>
          Are there wireframes? Specs? What is the brand we are communicating?
          At a scrappy startup, often times, a front end dev is also the
          designer. Otherwise, reach out to design team for this.
        </li>

        <li>
          Where in the product can we find similar interactions and UI? Brand
          consistency matters.
        </li>

        <li>
          What are the explicit interactions of this page? What are the implicit
          and explicit behavior and outcomes? Where does this fit within rest of
          product / interaction? It is so, so, so important to be as granular as
          possible here. It pays hugely to spend a lot of time here fleshing out
          every little detail. You can do your job with ambiguity, but you can
          do your job far more effectively with specificity.
        </li>

        <li>
          What is the technical scope of the change? Is it purely UI? Will I
          need to work on the server? Who is my point of contact in which I may
          depend upon if working in unfamiliar territory.
        </li>

        <li>
          What do the wireframes look like translated to UI? What does this UI
          look like broken down into components? What is the minimal state
          representation of the UI?
        </li>

        <li>
          Are we talking to API’s? How are we handling the loading case? How are
          we handling caching? How are we managing latency?
        </li>

        <li>
          Are we displaying data? How much? If large dataset, do we have a
          pagination strategy? Is there someone / somewhere else within product
          I can reference?
        </li>

        <li>Is this a mobile app or website?</li>

        <li>
          How are we managing state transitions? UI entropy can quickly get out
          of hand.
        </li>

        <li>
          What is the acceptance criteria? If you carefully detailed the
          interactions, behavior, and outcomes as stated above, this is your
          acceptance criteria.
        </li>

        <li>
          What is the rollout plan? Beta? Percentage rollout? Phased released?
          A/B Testing? Do we have tracking and analytics in place? Have we added
          sufficient test coverage end-to-end? Unit, integration, and UI?
        </li>
        <h3>tl;dr</h3>
        <p>as a dev, your job is to translate thought into code. clear, concise, thoughts = clear, conside, code</p>
        <p>it's in your best interest to gather the requirements yourself, drill down, get as specific as possible, THEN implement</p>
      </ul>
